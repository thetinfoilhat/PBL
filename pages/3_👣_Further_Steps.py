    """The problem of misinformation is far from being completely solved. Without widespread reform and enforcement, misinformation will continue
    to spread through media as long as there is an audience. Our project serves as a method for consumers to check the information they encounter
    and encourage them to question misinformation. The most effective way to eliminate this problem is to censor misinformation completely. However,
    this raises many ethical and political concerns and may cause people to be supressed. The issue of misinformation is complex and dynamic with no 
    straightforward solution. From this project, we have learned about the sources of misinformation, why misinformation spreads, and the true
    scope of this global problem. Our project is a step in the right direction and we hope that someday, no one will have to worry about misinformation
    as humanity progresses towards future free of deception."""
